            <h4>By Law or to Protect Rights</h4>

This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

            <p>We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>
            <h4>Third-Party Service Providers</h4>
            <p>We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.</p>
            <h4>Marketing Communications</h4>

            <h4>Online Postings</h4>
            <p>When you post comments, contributions, or other content to the Site, your posts may be viewed by all users and may be publicly distributed outside the Site in perpetuity.</p>

            <p>We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</p>
            <h4>Business Partners</h4>
            <p>We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.</p>

            <h3>Security of Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
            <h3>Policy for Children</h3>
            <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13.

If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [email].</p>
            <h3>Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h3>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
